## Document Database
Document databases are considered to be non-relational (or NoSQL) databases. Instead of storing data in fixed rows and columns, document databases use flexible documents. 
An intuitive data model that is fast and easy for developers to work with.

Document databases typically have an API or query language that allows developers to execute the CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations.

Create: Documents can be created in the database. Each document has a unique identifier.
Read: Documents can be read from the database. The API or query language allows developers to query for documents using their unique identifiers or field values. Indexes can be added to the database in order to increase read performance.
Update: Existing documents can be updated â€” either in whole or in part.
Delete: Documents can be deleted from the database.
